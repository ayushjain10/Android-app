# Android-app-quiz
Developed a quiz Android application

This application asks the user a set of questions and at the end displays the score.

Score at each screen is transfered to another screen using Intent and the final score is displayed at the end.

The design part of the application is written in AndroidManifest.xml.

The backend is handled using Java where functions such as onCreate, onClick are overriden with new implementation.
